                                    <strong>Why Migratrac?</strong> 
                                    There is little, known about the routes of migratory birds such as nightingales and flycatchers. 
                                    There remains a paucity of information about   these bird's rest stops and final destination. 
                                    Without knowing exactly their migratory itinerary, we cannot understand how to conserve them. 
                                    Understanding the routes these birds take can help us preserve them by providing shelter during migration. 
                                    Providing refuge for migratory birds by preserving existing forest and the restoration of former forests along
                                    their route can considerably reduce the population declines of these birds. The number of birds that can 
                                    be saved by the forest when adverse weather conditions coincide with migration will be highly remarkable. 
                                    It is believed that an IoT system that acoustically monitors the night-flight calls of migrating birds offers enormous 
                                    potential for improving understanding of migration routes, migration timing, and species composition at specific locations.
                                    <strong>What is Migratrac?</strong> 
                                    Migratrac is an  IoT system that detects and records the night-flight calls of birds,sends the detected flight call 
                                    wirelessly to a cloud service platform for sound analysis using a trained machine learning model. With the model's machine 
                                    learning algorithm and a data set of known bird's flight call, the specific bird specie making the migration 
                                    is determined. Also, by interpreting the bird's call sequences, the minimum number of birds migrating at that period is 
                                    approximated. An interface is used to display this information along with the presumable migration routes and timings.
